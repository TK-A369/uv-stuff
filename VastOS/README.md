# VastOS

VastOS is very basic modular operating system made for microcontrollers in my Universe Vastness game.

I may say that it uses microkernel architecture, because OS core does only few basic things: thread management and inter-thread communication.

**Warining!** Currently, it's suited to being used with normal standalone Lua interpreter, because it's very new. This hasn't been tested in game yet.

Function descriptions are in comments.
